GNMAPPER

This is a shell script (primarily written with awk) for parsing one or more gnmap files (nmap's greppable format) into a CSV.

This is based on GNU Awk (gawk) so make sure you have gawk installed and in your path.

Usage:

  ./gnmapper /path/to/file.gnmap /path/to/files/*.gnmap | tee myReport.csv

#|| OR try something like:

  find /some/path -maxdepth 5 -type f -name "*.gnmap" | xargs ./gnmapper | tee myReport.csv

Please note that I am using tee to write my CSV. You can obviously use output redirection with >, >> or &>.

I used tee so you can see your output while creating the file.

Thanks!
